# The 50 States
This was originally a very simple site that uses CSS grid to make a group of 50 cards with the 50 states completely
responsive. I refactored it into a React app and added search functionality using [Andrei Neagoie's Robofriends project code](https://github.com/aneagoie/robofriends) 
as guidance since the idea is similar. I might keep adding features to this project if I get more
ideas. For now, enjoy and search for a US state to quickly see it's capital and abbreviation.
